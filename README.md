## Machine learning code

Code comparing six different machine learning algorithms used for analysis of miscarriage cases in the SweMaMi study
- svmRadial
- Elastic Net
- classic Random Forest
- Ranger Random Forest
- Neural Networks with feature extraction
- k-Nearest Neighbor

This version was used to analyze questionnaire variables, but the same approach was used for microbiome variables

Includes five random test cohorts to account for low power
